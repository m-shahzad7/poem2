Beneath the stars so calm and high,
The moonlight paints the midnight sky.
A whisper floats on winds that roam,
And every heart finds thoughts of home.


Kerala, land of lush green grace,
Where backwaters flow in calm embrace.
Mountains rise and oceans sing,
God’s own country, eternal spring.

 
Whispers of dawn in golden light,
Chase away the fading night.
Dreams dissolve in morning's hue,
Hope awakes, alive and new.

On fields of green, the players dash,
With every pass, a sudden flash.
The crowd erupts, the goal is near—
In football's game, we conquer fear. 🏆⚽
